# Interns-Project-10---Advance-PHP-Live-Search-

There are two folders here.

One (PHP-CRUD folder) is my updated and modified output on Interns Project #09 where I tried to add the search functionality. It is not yet done and I am still working on it.

Second (search folder) is my output when I tried to copy and follow along the tutorial from https://youtu.be/a5UGrlEwSfI. 

Both of which are not yet functioning properly and I am still working and developing them.

Thank you.
