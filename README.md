# Interns-Project-10---Advance-PHP-Live-Search-

There are three folders here.

One (PHP-CRUD folder) is my final output for Interns Project #10.

Second (search folder) is my output when I tried to copy and follow along the tutorial from https://youtu.be/a5UGrlEwSfI. 

Third (crud folder) is the database folder. Add these folder to your database directory on. When using laragon with phpMyAdmin, add this crud folder to â†’ \laragon\data\mysql

Both of which are not yet functioning properly and I am still working and developing them.

Thank you.
